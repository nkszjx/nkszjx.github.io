<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Urban tree canopy maps are essential to urban ecosystem services. The relationship of urban trees with urban climate change,
air pollution, urban noise, biodiversity, urban crime, health, poverty, and social inequality provides
important information for us better understanding and managing cities. To better service the urban ecosystem of Brazil,
we developed a semi-supervised deep learning method, which is able to learn semantic segmentation knowl-
edge from both a certain amount of labeled images and a large number of unlabeled ones, 
to segmentation urban trees from high spatial resolution remote sensing images. Via this approach, we created 0.5 m fine-scale tree canopy
products over 472 cities in Brazil and made them freely available to the community. Results show that the urban tree canopy 
coverage in Brazil is between 5% and 35%, and the urban average tree canopy cover of Brazil is about
18.68%. Statistical results of these tree canopy maps quantifies a national wide urban tree canopy inequality problem of Brazil. 
Urban tree canopy coverage of 342 cities that can accommodate about 42% of the total population is less
than 20%, while 130 cities that can accommodate about 27.22% of the total population have tree canopy cover larger than 20%. 
In addition, we found that many small-area cities with low tree canopy coverage need more attention
from the Brazilian government. For cities with canopy cover of 0%âˆ¼20%, there are 231 cities with area less than 25 km2. 
We expect the urban tree canopy maps will encourage research into Brazilian urban ecosystem services to
support urban development and improve inhabitants quality of life to achieve the goals of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
In addition, it can serve as benchmark dataset for other high-resolution and mid/low-resolution remote sensing images urban tree canopy mapping results assessment.</p>
