<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>Urban tree canopy maps are essential for providing urban ecosystem services. The relationship between urban
trees and urban climate change, air pollution, urban noise, biodiversity, urban crime, health, poverty, 
and social inequality provides important information for better understanding and management of cities. To better service Brazil’s
urban ecosystem, we developed a semi-supervised deep learning method, which is able to learn semantic segmentation 
knowledge from both labeled and unlabeled images, to segment urban trees from high spatial resolution remote
sensing images. Using this approach, we created 0.5 m fine-scale tree canopy products for 472 cities in Brazil and
made them freely available to the community. Results showed that the urban tree canopy coverage in Brazil is between
5% and 35%, and the average urban tree canopy cover is approximately 18.68%. The statistical results of these tree
canopy maps quantify the nationwide urban tree canopy inequality problem in Brazil. Urban tree canopy coverage
from 130 cities that can accommodate approximately 27.22% of the total population is greater than 20%, whereas 342
cities that can accommodate approximately 42% of the total population have tree canopy cover less than 20%. 
Moreover, we found that many small-area cities with low tree canopy coverage require great attention from the Brazilian
government. We expect that urban tree canopy maps will encourage research on Brazilian urban ecosystem services
to support urban development and improve inhabitants’ quality of life to achieve the goals of the Agenda for Sustainable Development. 
	In addition, it can serve as a benchmark dataset for other high-resolution and mid/low-resolution
remote sensing images urban tree canopy mapping results assessments.

<h2>Study area </h2>
<p>The Federative Republic of Brazil has a land area of 8.5 million km2 and a population of over 214 million. Mainland of Brazil lies between latitudes 5◦N and 35◦S, and longitudes 35◦W and 74◦W. Fig.1 shows the specific
location.</p>

<h3> Workflow of this study </h3>	
<p> There are two mainstreams in our work. One stream generates urban mask products and the second stream generates tree canopy products.</p>

<h3> Training Dataset </h3>	
<p>Urban tree canopy mapping dataset and Urban mask mapping dataset </p>
	<div align="center"><img src="/figure/TUB/sample_label.png" width="100%"></div>	



<h3> Training Networks </h3>	
	
<p>In this study, we used the same semi-supervised learning framework to train two CNN models for urban tree and mask segmentation, respectively. 
We use Deeplabv3+ (Chen et al., 2018) as our segmentation network.  
A standard binary classification network was designed as the discriminator in this semi-supervised adversarial learning framework.
